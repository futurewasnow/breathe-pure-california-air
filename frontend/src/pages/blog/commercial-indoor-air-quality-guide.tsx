        <h2>Common Indoor Air Quality Issues in Commercial Buildings</h2>
        <p>
          Commercial properties face unique air quality challenges due to their size, occupancy patterns, and mechanical systems. 
          The most common issues include:
        </p>

        <h3>1. Ventilation Inadequacies</h3>
        <p>
          Many commercial buildings—particularly older structures—suffer from insufficient fresh air exchange. Modern energy 
          conservation measures sometimes exacerbate this problem by tightly sealing buildings without adequately addressing 
          ventilation needs.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Duct Contamination</h3>
        <p>
          Over time, commercial air ducts accumulate dust, allergens, mold spores, and other contaminants. When HVAC systems 
          operate, these particles circulate throughout the building. Regular <Link to="/services/commercial-air-duct-cleaning" className="text-brand-600 hover:underline">commercial air duct cleaning</Link> 
          is essential for removing these pollutants. For detailed information on how to tell when cleaning is needed, check out our guide on

        <p>
          <Link to="/services/commercial-air-duct-cleaning" className="text-brand-600 hover:underline">Commercial HVAC systems</Link> generate significant condensation, which can lead to moisture accumulation and mold growth 
          if not properly managed. This is particularly problematic in humid climates or buildings with water damage history.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)</h3>
        <p>
          Office equipment, cleaning products, building materials, and furnishings can emit harmful VOCs. These chemicals 
          contribute to symptoms like headaches, irritation, and cognitive impairment among employees.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Particulate Matter</h3>
        <p>
          Fine particles from outside pollution, paper dust, equipment operation, and human activity can remain suspended 
          in indoor air for hours, potentially causing respiratory irritation.
        </p>

        <h2>Signs Your Commercial Building Has Air Quality Problems</h2>
        <p>Watch for these warning indicators that your facility may need <Link to="/services/commercial-air-duct-cleaning" className="text-brand-600 hover:underline">air quality attention</Link>:</p>
