          <h1>Residential Dryer Vent Cleaning: Keeping Your Home Safe & Efficient</h1>

          <p>
            Dryer vent cleaning is one of the most important, yet often overlooked, maintenance tasks for homeowners.
            At <Link to="/" className="text-brand-600 hover:underline">Pure Air California</Link>, we help Los Angeles homeowners prevent dryer fires, reduce energy costs,
            and prolong the life of their appliances with professional residential dryer vent cleaning services.
          </p>

          <h2>The Importance of Clean Dryer Vents</h2>
          <p>
            Every time you use your dryer, lint separates from your clothes. While the lint trap catches much of this
            material, a significant amount still passes into the venting system. Over time, this lint accumulates in the
            vent, creating serious safety and efficiency problems:
          </p>

          <h3>Fire Hazard</h3>
          <p>
            Lint is highly flammable. When it accumulates in your dryer vent, it creates perfect conditions for a fire.
            The high heat from your dryer can cause lint to ignite, and once it does, the fire can quickly spread through
            the vent to your walls and throughout your home.
          </p>

          <h3>Reduced Efficiency & Higher Energy Costs</h3>
          <p>
            When lint blocks your dryer vent, the hot, moist air from your dryer cannot escape efficiently. This forces
            your dryer to work harder and run longer to dry your clothes, consuming more energy and increasing your
            utility bills. Many homeowners report savings of $25-35 per month after a thorough dryer vent cleaning.
          </p>

          <h3>Premature Appliance Failure</h3>
          <p>
            The strain placed on your dryer from a clogged vent shortens its operational lifespan. Components like
            heating elements, thermostats, and motors wear out faster when your dryer runs longer and hotter than
            necessary. Professional dryer vent cleaning can extend your appliance's life by years.
          </p>

          <h2>Our Residential Dryer Vent Cleaning Process</h2>
          <p>
            At Pure Air California, we use a comprehensive process to ensure your dryer vent is completely free of lint
            and debris:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Inspection:</strong> We start by thoroughly inspecting your entire dryer vent system, from the connection at the dryer to the exterior vent.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Professional Equipment:</strong> We use specialized rotary brushes and high-powered vacuum systems designed specifically for dryer vents.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Complete Cleaning:</strong> Our process removes 100% of lint buildup, not just the accessible portions near the connections.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Airflow Verification:</strong> After cleaning, we test the system to ensure proper airflow has been restored.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Safety Check:</strong> We check for proper vent material, secure connections, and compliance with current safety codes.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h2>How Often Should Dryer Vents Be Cleaned?</h2>
          <p>
            The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) recommends that dryer vents be inspected and cleaned at
            least once per year. However, several factors may warrant more frequent cleaning:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>High-volume households doing many loads of laundry weekly</li>
            <li>Homes with pets that shed significant hair and dander</li>
            <li>Long or complex dryer vent runs with multiple bends or turns</li>
            <li>Older dryer models with less efficient lint trapping systems</li>
            <li>Drying heavy items like towels, bedding, or rugs frequently</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>DIY Maintenance Between Professional Cleanings</h2>
          <p>
            While annual professional cleaning is essential, here are steps you can take between service appointments:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Clean the lint filter before every load (not just when it looks full)</li>
            <li>Periodically check the exterior vent hood for obstructions like bird nests or debris</li>
            <li>Vacuum around and under your dryer regularly to remove lint that has escaped</li>
            <li>When moving your dryer, inspect the vent connection for damage or disconnection</li>
            <li>Use rigid metal ducts rather than flexible plastic or foil accordion-type ducts</li>
            <li>Keep the area around your dryer free from items that could restrict airflow</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Remember that DIY maintenance complements but doesn't replace professional cleaning, as lint accumulates
            throughout the entire duct system, not just near the connections.
          </p>
